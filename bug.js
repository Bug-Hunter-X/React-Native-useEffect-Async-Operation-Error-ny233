In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions.  Consider this example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some_url');
    setData(await response.json());
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

This code fetches data on mount. However, if the component unmounts before the `fetchData` promise resolves, it can lead to errors or memory leaks.  The `setData` call might attempt to update a component that no longer exists.
